Throughout this pandemic, Justin Trudeau and the Liberal government have been working hard to make sure you and your family are safe and supported during this challenging time.
The fiscal snapshot presented by Bill Morneau today highlights how Justin Trudeau and the Liberal government have been able to stabilize the economy and keep Canadians supported. 
This support is the largest peacetime investment in Canada’s history, and has allowed millions of Canadian families and businesses to keep receiving income during a time of uncertainty.
Here are few highlights of how Canadian families, workers, and small businesses are being supported, by the numbers:

More than 8.16 million people have received support from the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, providing $2,000 a month to Canadians who have lost their income due to COVID-19.



3.7 million Canadian families received a special one-time $300 top-up of the Canada Child Benefit for each child (and the Canada Child Benefit is increasing again this month to help with the high costs of raising kids).


3 million employees have been supported by the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy, by helping them stay in the workforce or return to work.


12 million low and modest income individuals and families received a special one-time payment through the GST credit. On average, single adults received $400 in additional benefits, and couples almost $600.


More than 600,000 students have received the Canada Emergency Student Benefit, providing $1,250 per month for eligible students (and $2,000 per month to those with dependents or a disability).


6.7 million seniors are receiving a one-time tax-free payment of $300, and those who are also eligible for the GIS are also receiving an additional $200.


More than 688,000 applicants have been approved for the Canada Emergency Business Account, to help ensure small businesses can keep our economy strong through this difficult time.

Learn more on our blog about the steps the Liberal government is taking to keep Canadians safe, healthy, and supported throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
The health and safety of Canadians is our top priority. As our economy gradually and safely reopens, our Liberal government will continue to ensure that Canadians have the support they need.
We’ll get through this together — and as Justin Trudeau has said, you can be sure that our country will come roaring back.

June 2, 2020
I rise today to address what so many people of colour live with every day.
Over the past few days, we’ve seen horrific reports of police violence against Black men and women south of the border.
But these are not isolated incidents or elsewhere problems.
Prejudice, discrimination, and violence is a lived reality for far too many people.
It is the result of systems which far too often condone, normalize, perpetrate, and perpetuate inequality and injustice against people of colour.
As a country, we are not concerned bystanders simply watching what is happening next door.
We are part of it.
The calls for justice, for equality, for peace, have found echo in our communities because anti-Black racism is also happening here.
Everywhere in Canada.
Every single day. 
This is something that our own staff, Cabinet ministers, and colleagues face even in these halls.
Over the past few days, I’ve heard many of these personal stories directly from them.
And I’m not just talking about acts of violence. I’m also talking about microaggressions, which many of us may not even see.
That is the daily reality of far too many racialized Canadians. And it needs to stop.
When it comes to being an ally, I have made serious mistakes in the past – mistakes which I deeply regret, and continue to learn from.
And I want to thank my colleagues, community leaders, and fellow Canadians for opening my eyes to what is really going on in our communities and helping me better understand both privilege and power.
I’m not perfect.
But not being perfect is not a free pass to not do the right thing.
It’s not an excuse to not step up.
To stand up for each other, to be an ally.
I know that for so many people listening right now, the last thing you want to hear is another speech on racism from a white politician.
I’m not here today to describe a reality I do not know or speak to a pain I have not felt. 
I’m here because I want you to know that our government is listening.
We hear your calls for justice, equality, and accountability.
We acknowledge your frustration, your anger, your heartbreak.
We see you.
Since taking office, our government has taken concrete action to fight anti-Black racism, systemic discrimination, and injustice across the country.
We have worked with communities to recognize and address injustices.
We’ve taken action to support community organizations, invest in better data, and fight racism.
For example, we have provided $9 million to support programs for young Black Canadians.
We have made significant investments to help the Public Health Agency of Canada provide more mental health services to those who have experienced racism or intergenerational trauma.
We are helping community organizations obtain funding to buy equipment or rent space.
And we have created the Anti-Racism Secretariat, which has a $4.6 million budget to eliminate systemic barriers that perpetuate injustice, notably in employment, justice, and social participation.
And while we’ve made some progress, there is still so much more to do.
Because here are the facts in Canada.
Anti-Black racism is real.
Unconscious bias is real.
Systemic discrimination is real.
For millions of Canadians, it is their daily, lived reality.
The pain and damage it causes is real, too.  
Mr. Speaker, every Canadian who has felt the weight of oppression, every student who has the courage to demand a better future, every person who marches and posts and reads and fights from Vancouver to Montréal to Halifax expects more than the status quo.
They expect more and deserve better.
The Government of Canada has a lot of work to do, but we are ready.
We are ready to work with our opposition colleagues, community leaders, and Canadians to make our country fairer and more equal.
Racism never has a place in our society.
And we will do everything we can to eradicate it from coast to coast.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

Canada’s seniors helped shape this country. They’ve been there for us, and now we need to be there for them.
Right now, many Canadian seniors are facing significant health, economic, and social challenges because of COVID-19. That’s why Justin Trudeau has announced new measures from the Liberal government to provide greater financial security for seniors to get through this challenging time.
This new support includes:

Investing $2.5 billion to provide a one-time tax-free payment of $300 for seniors eligible for the Old Age Security pension, and an additional $200 for those eligible for the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS). This means up to $500 for seniors who are eligible for both.


Expanding the New Horizons for Seniors Program, and investing $20 million in financial support for organizations that offer community-based projects to create even more programs across Canada to help seniors maintain or improve their social support network


Temporarily extending GIS and Allowance payments for qualifying seniors whose 2019 income has not been assessed, to make sure vulnerable seniors continue receiving their benefits when they need them most.

Read more about the Prime Minister’s announcement.
There’s no question that COVID-19 has taken its toll on seniors emotionally and financially. Today’s announcements build on the Liberal government’s previously-announced steps to support Canada’s seniors through the effects of COVID-19, such as:

Introducing the Canada Emergency Response Benefit for eligible workers, including seniors, who have lost their income as a result of COVID-19
Providing seniors flexibility with their Registered Retirement Income Funds by reducing minimum withdrawals
Investments in community organizations that provide immediate essential services, such as the delivery of groceries, medicine, and other needed items.

More than 4 million seniors also benefited from April’s one-time special payment through the GST credit, which provided an average of $375 for single seniors and $510 for senior couples — and the Liberal government has also invested in community organizations that provide practical services to seniors, including the delivery of groceries and medications.

Here’s a quick update.
We are all adapting to big new changes in our daily lives to keep each other safe from COVID-19, and so many Canadian families, workers, and businesses face real concerns about making ends meet. That’s why Justin Trudeau and the Liberal government are taking strong action to ensure that you and your loved ones are supported through this difficult time.
Here’s a quick breakdown of some of the steps our Liberal government is taking to help Canadians get through this together:
Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy:

A 75% wage subsidy available for businesses, big and small, that are not publicly funded and have seen a 30% or more decline in gross revenues. That includes everything from bars and restaurants, to charities and non-profits. Applications are now open through CRA.

Canada Emergency Response Benefit:

Providing $2,000 a month to workers who lose their income as a result of COVID-19. It doesn’t matter whether you worked full time, on contract, or were self-employed – you qualify. And as announced on April 15, Canadians who are earning less than $1000/month, were expecting seasonal work that now isn’t coming because of COVID-19, and those who have exhausted their EI benefits since January 1st, 2020 also qualify. Get all the details and apply for the benefit here. 

Guaranteed loans available to support businesses of all sizes:

If your business is struggling with cash flow due to COVID-19, the Liberal government is working to help you access credit more easily.
Find out how you can access these loans here.

$2 billion to support diagnostic testing, and purchase ventilators and personal protective equipment:


Personal protective equipment includes things like more masks and face shields, gowns, and hand sanitizer.

Investing more than $1 billion in support of a national medical research strategy to fight COVID-19:

Including vaccine development, the production of treatments, and tracking of the virus. This funding builds on the $275 million investment for coronavirus research and medical countermeasures previously announced. Learn more about this significant investment here.

More support for Canadian seniors:

Investing $2.5 billion to provide a one-time tax-free payment of up to $500 for those eligible for the Old Age Security (OAS) pension and the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS).
Expanding the New Horizons for Seniors Program, and investing $20 million in financial support for organizations that offer community-based projects to create even more programs across Canada to help seniors maintain or improve their social support network.
Temporarily extending GIS and Allowance payments for qualifying seniors whose 2019 income has not been assessed.

New funding and measures to support our most vulnerable people and communities:

Including crucial funding for Canadians experiencing homelessness, children and young people, and seniors impacted by COVID-19.
$350 million Emergency Community Support Fund to support charities and non-profits in their important work and get vulnerable Canadians the resources they need. More details here.

Additional support for students and new grads:

Introducing the Canada Emergency Student Benefit, providing support to students and new graduates who are not eligible for the CERB. This benefit will provide $1,250 per month for eligible students or $2,000 per month for eligible students with dependents or disabilities and will be available from May to August 2020.
Introducing the Canada Student Service Grant, which will help students gain valuable work experience and skills while they help their communities during the COVID‑19 pandemic.
Doubling the Canada Student Grants, broadening eligibility for student financial assistance, enhancing the Canada Student Loans Program, and more. Get all the details here. 

Targeted support for small and medium-sized businesses, and rural businesses:

$675 million to give financing support to small and medium-sized businesses that are not eligible for the measures already announced or that have specific needs, through Canada’s Regional Development Agencies
$287 million to support rural businesses and communities, including by providing them with much-needed access to capital through the Community Futures Program

And much more. See more of our updates here.
The health, safety, and well-being of Canadians is always our top priority. I’m deeply grateful for the sacrifices and hard work that so many of you are taking on to keep your families, neighbours, and communities safe.
It will take all of us doing our part to stop the spread of COVID-19 and support those in need, and I know that’s exactly how we will get through this – together.

I know there’s been nothing ordinary about these past few weeks – and I hope that you and your loved ones are keeping safe and healthy through it all.
Over these past six weeks, our entire focus as a party has been on getting out the crucial information and announcements that Canadians need so we can get through this difficult time together. That will continue to be our priority, and our Liberal government will continue doing everything possible to support Canadian workers, families, and businesses.
Right now, nothing about our daily lives is the same. That’s part of why it’s hard to believe that this week marks exactly six months since Election Day 2019, when Canadians voted to give Justin Trudeau and our Liberal team a new mandate to keep Canada moving forward.
It’s National Volunteer Week, too – and both milestones have me thinking about the incredible hope of hard work of the 90,000+ Liberal volunteers who made more than 21 million knocks and calls on the road to E-Day.
That’s why LPC President Suzanne Cowan, M.P. Omar Alghabra, and I joined EDA Chairs and other grassroots Liberal leaders from across Canada last week for a conversation about our government’s progress and our work to engage Canadians in our Liberal movement throughout 2020 and beyond.
Now we want to hear from you in our new Your Movement 2020 Survey.
While our teams and supporters can’t gather in person for now, the need to keep building a better future for all Canadians means our democratic engagement work is more important than ever.
You’re at the heart of this team. We want to hear from you about what tools you need to connect with your community online about our progress, to help us organize strong Liberal volunteer teams virtually, and to keep growing our open and inclusive movement in every part of Canada.

As Canadians continue working together to fight the spread of COVID-19, our government’s number one priority is ensuring that all Canadians are safe, healthy, and supported — including young Canadians.
Canada’s prosperity depends on young Canadians getting the education and the experience they need to succeed in today’s labour market, and students will define our path forward towards a better, more equal society. But that can be tough when there aren’t as many jobs, and when students are finding it hard to pay for tuition or day-to-day basics.
Our Liberal government is doing whatever it takes to help Canadians get through this difficult time, and no one should have to choose between taking action against COVID-19 and their education. That’s why today Justin Trudeau announced nearly $9 billion of comprehensive support to help students and recent grads:
Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB)

For students and recent graduates not covered by the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, this benefit would provide $1,250 per month from May through August for eligible students, and $1,750 for students with dependents or permanent disabilities. The Liberal government will be working with opposition parties to move forward on legislation to put this new Benefit in place.

Canada Student Service Grant (CSSG)

To help students gain valuable work experience and help their communities throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, this grant will provide up to $5,000 for a student’s education in the fall for students who choose to work in national service positions and serve their community.

Creating 76,000 jobs for young people in addition to the Canada Summer Jobs program, in sectors that need an extra hand right now or that are on the frontlines of this pandemic.
Doubling the Canada Students Grants Program for the 2020-2021 school year (and granting funding to support Quebec, Nunavut, and the Northwest Territories through their existing financial assistance programs for students).
Broadening the eligibility for Student Financial Assistance

This includes removing the expected student’s and spouse’s contributions for 2020-2021.

Enhancing the Canada Student Loans Program

Raising the maximum amount that can be provided from $210 to $350.

Over $75 million to increase support specifically for First Nations, Inuit, and Metis Nation students.
Extending expiring federal graduate research scholarships and postdoctoral fellowships as well as federal research grants, by providing $291.6 million to the federal granting councils.
These significant new supports will help young Canadians get through this difficult time and play a central role in ensuring Canada emerges from these challenges stronger than ever.
Ensuring that our youth have the skills and experience they need to succeed in today’s ever-changing labour market is key to strengthening our economy, building a more inclusive Canada, and ensuring that no one is left behind.
For more details on the Liberal government’s plan to support students and recent grads, please see the Prime Minister’s full news release.
You can also find out more about the strong action that the Liberal government is taking to support families, workers, businesses, and vulnerable Canadians affected by the COVID-19 crisis by reading about Canada’s Economic Response Plan, and seeing if you are eligible for support like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.

April 11, 2020
Mr. Speaker –
I rise here, in this moment, in this House, as our generation faces its greatest challenge yet. We all stand on the shoulders of those who came before us. Of all those Canadians who saw our nation through difficult, tumultuous times. 
Il y a 103 ans aujourd’hui, des jeunes soldats canadiens se trouvaient dans des tranchées en France, à des milliers de kilomètres de chez eux.
Le lendemain, ils prendraient d’assaut la cote 145 et participeraient à la dernière bataille de la crête de Vimy. Aujourd’hui, à l’aube de ce sombre anniversaire, nous nous souvenons de leur courage et de leur sacrifice. Nous nous souvenons des soldats qui ont façonné le pays que nous connaissons.
20 years later, many would be sent to the front again. On the evening of November 14  1940, my grandfather, the young MP from Vancouver North, rose in his seat to speak to the war effort, but first thanked all those senior members who allowed him to speak before them, because his leave from the RCAF had expired that night, and he was to ship out soon.
Jimmy Sinclair would spend the next three and a half years in Europe and North Africa, far from his young family, far from his work in this House of Commons, far from his constituents in BC, serving his country in the best way he knew how. He would return to the chamber in early 1944, a few months before D-Day, to exhort Canadians to continue with the sacrifices and efforts required to win.
“This is the year which will decide a rapid victory or a long and protracted war; a year when our fighting men must be given every conceivable aid and support and encouragement by every man, woman and child in Canada, no matter the personal cost.”
These were trials that shaped our country, and more, our citizens. And now, once again, we are being tried. But Mr. Speaker – this is not a war. That doesn’t make this fight any less destructive, any less dangerous. But there is no front line marked with barbed wire. No soldiers to be deployed across the ocean. No enemy combatants to defeat.
Instead, the front line is everywhere. In our homes.  In our hospitals and care centers. In our grocery stores and pharmacies. At our truck stops and gas stations. And the people who work in these places are our modern-day heroes.
Separated from their family, risking their own health – they head to work every day so that we can eat. So that we can heal. So that we can do our part. Because every one of us has a role to play in helping shield our country from the threat it now faces.
In hard times, courage and strength are not defined by what we say or do loudly, in public, but by the actions we take quietly, in private. Like staying home.
Even as we stand apart, we stand united in our resolve to do what we must until COVID-19 is defeated.
Monsieur le président, nous sommes ici aujourd’hui pour faire adopter la Subvention salariale d’urgence. Il s’agit de la politique économique canadienne la plus importante depuis la Deuxième Guerre mondiale. Cette subvention va permettre aux Canadiens de garder leur emploi et un chèque de paie pendant cette crise. C’est ce sur quoi nous voterons cet après-midi. 
Cette subvention s’appuie sur les démarches déjà entreprises pour venir en aide aux Canadiens, comme l’offre de prêts garantis aux petites entreprises et la Prestation canadienne d’urgence pour ceux qui ont perdu leur emploi.
Encore une fois, dans cette Chambre, nous sommes appelés à soutenir ceux qui sont dans le besoin et je sais que nous ne les laisserons pas tomber.
Mr. Speaker – As Canada confronts this crisis, we are all called to serve. To fight for and alongside each of our fellow citizens. To fight for someone’s mother. Someone’s grandfather. Someone’s neighbour. 
Our job as Canadians is to uphold the dignity and sanctity of every single human life – whether they be rich or poor, young or old, ailing or healthy. That is our duty.
Without reservation, without pause, we must fight for every inch of ground against this disease. We must be there for each other as we spare no effort to safeguard our collective future. 
Au cours des prochaines semaines et des prochains mois, nous ferons face à de nombreux obstacles. Nous traverserons d’autres moments incertains. La peur et l’inquiétude continueront de faire partie de notre quotidien. Et malheureusement, nous pleurerons ensemble la perte des nôtres.
Même si nous prenons toutes les précautions nécessaires, la situation risque d’empirer avant de s’améliorer. C’est la triste réalité à laquelle notre pays est confronté.
Notre détermination à en finir avec ce virus – notre engagement à veiller les uns sur les autres – seront mis à l’épreuve. Mais je sais que nous sommes à la hauteur du défi devant nous.
Canadians are among the most fortunate people on earth. Despite the challenges we have yet to overcome, despite the wrongs we have yet to right – ours is a country where we look out for one another. Where we take care of each other. 
That generosity of spirit and compassion was alive long before this virus reached our shores and it will survive long after it’s gone, because this is who we are.
Monsieur le Président, notre pays est en deuil. Trop de familles ont perdu un être cher en raison de cette pandémie. Cette maladie est d’autant plus cruelle puisqu’elle nous empêche de se rassembler pour pleurer la perte de ceux qui nous ont quittés et de célébrer leur vie entre amis et en famille.
Au nom de tous les Canadiens, j’offre mes plus sincères condoléances à ceux qui ont perdu un proche.
However this holiday weekend also marks the coming of rebirth and new life. Easter is a time when Christians honour the Passion, sacrifice and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth – and his teachings of compassion, forgiveness and love. 
Passover is a time when Jews recall the covenant made by God with the people of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah. And the heroism of Moses who led his people from bondage to freedom.
Vaishaki is a time when Sikhs and Hindus celebrate the new year and the spring harvest. And even for those who are not celebrating, Spring is always a time for renewal. These moments remind us that love, courage, and fortitude are the antidote to despair. That there is no challenge we can’t overcome together.
Durant ce long weekend, prenons un engagement entre nous de faire ce qui s’impose aussi longtemps qu’il le faudra. Et dans cette Chambre, faisons notre part pour remplir cet engagement. Prenons nos responsabilités et venons en aide à ceux qui sont dans le besoin.
Mr Speaker, as I stand here today, I think of the young men who died taking Vimy Ridge. I think of the Greatest Generation, who grew up during the Depression and fought through the Second World War. They showed us how to fight for what we believe in and how to sacrifice for what we hold dear.
Today, across this country, the last members of the Greatest Generation live in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. In their small apartments and in the houses they built so long ago, with their own hands.
They are the most threatened by this disease. They fought for us, all those years ago, and today, we will fight for them. We will show ourselves to be worthy of this beautiful country they built.
And for them, and for their grandchildren, we will endure, we will persevere, and we will prevail."

Today, Justin Trudeau announced our Liberal government’s latest step to support Canadians impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak.
The government will provide $100 million to food banks and food organizations across Canada to help meet the urgent food needs of vulnerable Canadians, including:

$50 million to Food Banks Canada
$20 million divided evenly between Salvation Army, Second Harvest, Community Food Centres Canada, and Breakfast Club of Canada
$30 million for local-level organizations who serve people experiencing food insecurity

As many Canadians turn to these vital organizations to feed their families, and with fewer donations and volunteers to count on, it’s more important than ever to make sure they have the necessary resources to keep helping people in our communities.
This new funding, delivered through the Government of Canada’s Local Food Infrastructure Fund, will provide more of the support these organizations need to bring food and other necessities to the people and communities experiencing food insecurity. That includes support for the purchasing, transportation, and distribution of food, hiring temporary help to fill volunteer shortages, and steps such as the purchase of personal protective equipment to reduce the spread of COVID-19 among volunteers and clients.
This new announcement  builds on the Liberal government’s continued commitment to supporting the most vulnerable, including crucial funding announced earlier this week for Canadians experiencing homelessness, children and young people, and seniors impacted by COVID-19.
For more details, please see the Prime Minister’s full news release.
From coast to coast to coast, Canadians like you have also stepped up to help keep your family, friends, and community safe and healthy. To those of you who have supported organizations that provide relief for the many Canadians facing food insecurity: thank you — and thank you to all frontline workers stepping up at this important moment. 
If you have not yet given to a food bank, and have the capacity to do so, please consider giving today. Your support can make a big difference! You can visit FoodBanksCanada.ca as one option for more information on how to help.
Last week, our government also announced that it will be covering 75% of wages for qualifying businesses and non-profits, as well as providing $2,000 a month for the next 4 months to Canadians who lose their income because of COVID-19, through the new Canada Emergency Response Benefit.

Navigating these uncertain times can be challenging.
Adjusting to both my daughters’ and my own new schedule at home has been a different reality for our family. But while the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting all of us in different ways, some people and communities are hit much harder and faster than others, and are more at risk to its impacts.
This week Justin Trudeau announced new measures to support the most vulnerable, including crucial funding for Canadians experiencing homelessness, children and young people, and seniors impacted by COVID-19. So many community organizations across Canada are delivering critical services to those who need it most, and our Liberal government is committed to supporting them in that work. Together, we’ll get through this.
While so many have been stepping up in important ways, I’m especially touched but not at all surprised to be hearing from so many Liberal supporters across the country who are taking the lead in their community or chipping in to local non-profits to help our most vulnerable. To all of you – thank you and keep it up.
And if you or your loved ones are among the countless frontline health care workers, first responders, grocery store employees, pharmacists, truck drivers, transit operators, researchers, essential service providers, and so many other Canadians who are working to keep us all safe and healthy, we are all tremendously grateful.

Small businesses are the backbone of Canada’s economy, supporting millions of jobs and making our communities better places to live. Now though, many are facing difficult decisions and are worried about the months ahead — as they face economic hardship or uncertainty as a result of COVID-19.
That’s why today, Justin Trudeau announced more measures the Liberal government is taking as part of the COVID-19 Economic Response Plan to help Canadian businesses and workers through this difficult time, and ensure that our economy remains strong in the face of adversity. 
Together, these steps will allow companies to keep more Canadians on the payroll, or think about hiring them back.
Some highlights of these new steps include:


75% wage subsidy for qualifying businesses through the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy
Backdated to March 15 — to support businesses, and help keep Canadian workers on the payroll. For companies whose revenue has decreased by at least 30% due to COVID-19 – including everything from bars and restaurants, to charities and non-profits. This subsidy is applicable to the first $58,700 of an employee’s salary – which means up to $847 per week*. Applications are now open through CRA.
Launching the new Canada Emergency Business Account
Allowing banks to offer $40,000 government-guaranteed loans to qualifying businesses, interest-free for the first year.
$12.5 Billion in funding through Export Development Canada and Business Development Bank
To help businesses apply for guaranteed loans through their financial institutions to weather the impacts of COVID-19.
Deferring HST/GST Payments, as well as duties and taxes owed on imports, until June
To help businesses use that money to cover immediate needs instead.

For more details, please see the Prime Minister’s full news release detailing these new measures, or watch today’s announcement here.
Canada’s Economic Response Plan is taking strong action to help Canadian workers, families, and businesses get through this. We’re all in this together, and the Liberal government will continue to work around the clock to ensure all Canadians and small businesses get the support they need to weather this crisis.

Whether it’s for details on physical distancing, prevention, info for returning travelers, or more, you can also visit Canada.ca/Coronavirus for the most up-to-date information and resources to help keep you and your loved ones safe and prepared.
Thank you for all you are doing to help Canadians get through this together, and all our best.

In these challenging times, the Liberal team has your back — and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the entire government are taking every action needed to protect the health and safety of Canadians, and our economy.
Here’s a quick summary of recent steps:
Last week, Justin Trudeau announced a $1 billion COVID-19 Response Fund. This will provide money to provinces and territories to support our healthcare system & workers, support public health preparedness and research, and help limit the spread of the virus. 
The Liberal government is also waiving the one-week waiting period for EI sick leave benefits to kick in, and enhancing the Work-Sharing Program to help employers who are facing a downturn in business. Finance Minister Bill Morneau also announced a further $10 billion commitment to help stabilize our economy and protect workers and businesses across the country.
Yesterday, the Prime Minister also announced that Canada will deny entry to most people who are not citizens or permanent residents, as well as anyone who shows symptoms of COVID- 19 before boarding. 
In addition, every traveller will need to remain in self isolation for 14 days if they come to Canada by plane or through the land border — and international entry is also being limited to YYZ (Toronto), YUL (Montreal), YVR (Vancouver), and YYC (Calgary).
The Liberal government is also hard at work to create the right support package for Canadians, while protecting people’s jobs and our economy. And tomorrow, the  government will be making another major announcement on economic actions to support Canadians as quickly as possible.
As the Prime Minister said today, we also need to be thinking about how we lighten the load of our dedicated frontline health care workers, and keep our families and communities safe. Do wash your hands often. Do sneeze into your elbow. And don’t gather in groups of more than 50 people. We know that these measures, and especially social distancing, are how we can ease the burden on our doctors and nurses, so they can focus on our fellow Canadians who need it most.

Your health and safety will always be our top priority — and on behalf of all of us at the Liberal Party of Canada, thank you for the work you’re doing to support our communities, our frontline healthcare workers, and all Canadians.

The following is a note from Justin Trudeau on March 13, 2020 – For the latest news on Canada’s whole-of-government response to COVID-19 and action to keep Canadians healthy and safe, please also visit pm.gc.ca and Canada.ca/Coronavirus

I have some personal news to share with you.
As you may know by now, Sophie recently returned from a speaking event in the UK feeling ill, and was experiencing mild flu-like symptoms. Unfortunately, after being tested for COVID-19, the test results came back as positive. She is feeling well, and her symptoms remain mild, however she will be in quarantine for the time being.
Sophie also wanted to share this note with you today:

To all my friends, family, beloved Canadians, and allies everywhere:
First, I’d like to say a big thank you to all of you who have reached out to me asking how I’m doing. Although I’m experiencing uncomfortable symptoms of the virus, I will be back on my feet soon. Being in quarantine at home is nothing compared to other Canadian families who might be going through this and for those facing more serious health concerns.
We will get through this situation together. Please share the facts and take your health seriously. I send you all my courage and warm thoughts (but only “get better” hugs from afar)!
Sincerely,
– Sophie

We are thinking about all the families across the country who have received the same diagnosis. I want to be clear that I have no symptoms. I’m feeling good, and technology allows me to work from home. Of course, it’s an inconvenience, and somewhat frustrating – we are all social beings after all. But we have to do this because we have to protect our neighbours and our friends, especially our more vulnerable seniors and people with pre-existing conditions.
This week, we have continued to outline more of Canada’s whole-of-government response to COVID-19, including by establishing a COVID-19 Response Fund of more than $1 billion – and there will be more to do. All orders of government are working together, and today I convened a call with the premiers and Indigenous leaders to discuss the latest developments and coordinate our efforts.
We have announced new restrictions on the upcoming cruise ship season, and additional screening measures have been put in place at all international airports, as well as land border, ferry, and rail ports of entry. Health Canada is now advising against all non-essential travel outside of Canada. Minister Bill Morneau announced a $10 billion credit program to mitigate COVID-19’s impact on our economy. We passed legislation to ratify the new NAFTA, and we reached an agreement with the other parties to suspend the House of Commons until April 20 while still protecting our ability to support Canadians with emergency funding.
We’ve also been clear that no one should have to worry about paying rent, buying groceries, or additional childcare because of COVID-19 – and we will help Canadians financially. We are in the enviable position of having significant fiscal firepower available to support you, and the Government of Canada will be moving forward with a substantial fiscal stimulus package in the days ahead.

Today, Canadians from coast to coast to coast are taking to Twitter and other social media to fight the stigma surrounding mental illness and help create positive change in the conversation around mental health for Bell Let’s Talk Day.
Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team know that there is no health without mental health, and that’s why we’ve committed to set national standards for access to mental health services — because Canadians should be able to get fast access to the support they need when they need it. 
See what the Liberal team is saying on this #BellLetsTalk Day:

It’s the 10th year of #BellLetsTalk and, while we’ve come a long way from where the conversation on mental health started, there’s still more work to do to end stigma & make sure Canadians can get the support they need. So let’s keep talking, Canada!
— Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) January 29, 2020
 

  “Let’s support one another and be courageous and vulnerable in sharing our stories. By doing that, we can save lives.”
Sophie Grégoire Trudeau


  “Initiatives like Bell Let’s Talk Day remind us to tell our family, friends, colleagues, and neighbours: you are not alone. We need to support each other, and change the conversation around mental health. Today and every day, let’s be there for one another.”
Patty Hajdu


  “Asking for help can be the bravest and most important thing you’ll ever do.”
Seamus O’Regan


  “We can all help fight the stigma around mental health. Pay attention to the words you use, educate yourself, be kind, listen, and start a dialogue (not a debate) about mental illness.”
Adam van Koeverden


  “No Canadian should go without the comprehensive mental health support they need.”
Hedy Fry


  “Mental health matters, and people struggling with mental health matter. As a government we must ensure our communities can be there for Canadians and as individuals, we must make it okay for anyone to ask for help.”
Rachel Bendayan


  “We need to work together to reduce the stigma around mental illness. No matter your age, culture, gender, or sexual orientation: you are important and loved just the way you are.”

In 2020, our Liberal government will also be moving forward with our plan to deliver real and positive change for Canadians, as we work together to invest in the middle class, grow our economy, keep our communities safe, and protect our environment.
More than 30,000 Canadians answered our Priorities for Parliament survey last month, and these were your top 10 responses about which commitments mattered most to you in our 2019 Platform:
Cutting taxes for the middle class, and lowering cell phone bills by 25%

Working to ensure that every Canadian has access to a family doctor, mental health services, affordable prescription drugs, and home care and palliative care when they need it
Committing Canada to net-zero emissions by 2050
Increasing the Old Age Security benefit by 10% for seniors when they turn 75
 
Banning military-style assault rifles and strengthening gun control in Canada
Making student grants more generous and student loans more affordable
Helping families retrofit their homes to lower energy costs and be prepared in the event of a flood

More help for first-time home buyers, and tackling housing speculation by non-resident, non-Canadian foreign owners
Increasing the Canada Child Benefit by 15% for families with kids under one, and making maternity and parental benefits tax-free up front
Cutting taxes in half for companies that produce zero emissions technologies

To move forward with this progress and so much more, we need your support to ensure a strong start to 2020 and this new mandate.

Watch Justin Trudeau’s speech here.
Good morning, everyone. It’s great to be here at Nano One, joined by our strong Liberal team and particularly the next Member of Parliament for right here in Burnaby South, Neelam Brar.
It’s been a busy few weeks of criss-crossing the country with our Liberal team. 
We’ve had policy announcements and rallies. We’ve met with workers and families. And we’ve talked about our real plan to keep growing the middle class.
Today, I want to take a bit of time to reflect on our Liberal vision for the future of Canada.
A vision that moves Canada forward, and does so by tackling the most fundamental challenge facing our generation – climate change.
Last Friday, we saw historic demonstrations for climate action in cities around the world. More than 4 million people participated in climate strikes, from Germany to Uganda, from Australia to Bangladesh.
People young and old showed up to demand leadership and change.
But we shouldn’t be surprised.
We are living in a breathtaking, pivotal moment. Citizens are coming to a major realization: The climate crisis is real, and people are waking up. 
And it’s because young people – led by the likes of 16-year-old Greta Thunberg – are driving the conversation. 
They’ve seen the science – things are now more urgent than ever before.
They’ve seen the impact, with floods and fires destroying entire communities. With forced migration. With dwindling air quality. With species extinction.
And these kids are scared, because they know this will become their mess to clean up. 
Climate change has been a catalyst for some tough but inspiring conversations with my own kids, who, like so many of their friends, just seem to get it.
Unfortunately, not everyone can say the same.
Some politicians, usually in Conservative parties, throw their hands up and say there’s nothing we can do. They recoil, falling back on the approach they know best – neglecting our environment, and pretending climate change isn’t real.
Or, if you’re former Conservative Finance Minister Joe Oliver, you admit that climate change is real, then you turn around and insist it’s a good thing for Canada…
But here’s what we as Liberals say: the climate crisis is real, but we can’t waste anymore time – Conservative leaders have wasted enough. 
It will take courage and planning. Grassroots leadership and government investment. 
But if we mitigate and adapt, we can win the fight against climate change. And we can lead that fight from right here in Canada – in fact, we have to, since our country’s warming nearly twice as fast as the rest of the world.
Whether you’re exploring the Rockies or Gros Morne, sledding in the country, or cottaging around the Laurentians, being outside and enjoying our environment is core to our identity.  
And so Canadians understand that our precious natural world is worth protecting. 
Sure, it’ll take hard work.
But you know what else took hard work? The acid rain treaty. Immigration. Universal health care. The Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
This is the Canadian way – we face the challenges in front of us head on, together. 
We don’t cower because something is hard. 
As Liberals, we know that’s even more reason to do it now, and to get it right.
Years from now, I want to look my kids in the eyes and say we stepped up in the fight against climate change. And we’ve already started the hard work.
Our plan isn’t perfect. But we’re making real progress. 
Putting a price on pollution, protecting our oceans, phasing out coal, banning single-use plastics – these aren’t piecemeal policies, but crucial parts of a larger plan.
Businesses are stepping up too, but not fast enough. We need them to act, because as a government and as citizens, we can’t do it alone.
We have to move faster than ever before. We have to stay hungry for change. We have to keep going. 
So a re-elected Liberal government will keep moving Canada forward.
Canada is on track to reduce our emissions by 30% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels.
And just this morning, we committed to exceeding this target, and to joining countries around the world in reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. That means not putting any more carbon emissions into the air than we take out. 
This will be a huge opportunity for Canadians.
It’ll require us to slash our emissions, transform our economy, and use the power of nature – like planting trees and protecting ecosystems – to bring us to net-zero.
It’s an ambitious target, but it’s doable. Here in Canada, we’ll appoint a group of experts to help us chart a path forward, and we’ll legislate five-year targets along the way.
We will hit net-zero by 2050 – not only because we can, but because we must.
And a big part of our plan to get to net-zero includes creating an economic ecosystem where clean tech companies can thrive.
The global clean tech economy is a multi-trillion dollar opportunity. And so, the clean tech market is exploding. 
This is the way the world is going. This is the next great economic frontier. 
Companies and countries are already innovating. They see what’s coming, and they want in – not only to curb the impacts of climate change, but to capitalize.
But Conservatives want to bury their heads in the sand, denying the science and hoping that other countries will step up. 
They have no plan to reduce emissions. They have no plan for jobs. They have no plan for the future.
All they’ve done is drive innovators away.
Liberals, on the other hand, want Canada to lead in the global clean tech race. We want to drive that solution. 
That’s why a re-elected Liberal government will cut corporate tax in half for zero-emissions clean tech companies. This would include, for example, companies building battery technology for electric vehicles, or those working on next generation solar panels.
We have the talent, we have the vision, and we already have the reputation as the best place in the world to start and grow a clean tech business.
And as we move Canada forward, we need to make sure no one gets left behind.
That’s why we’ll introduce a Just Transition Act, ensuring that workers have access to the training and support they need to succeed in the new clean economy. The concept of a Just Transition Act was a focus of the Paris Climate Agreement — Canada will be among the first countries in the world to put this idea into practice, as we help Canadian communities thrive now and into the future.
Together, we will move Canada forward – building a country where clean tech companies can thrive, where businesses and citizens are encouraged to go green, and where workers can succeed in the clean energy transition. 
My friends, here’s the reality – the major policy discussions ahead of us will be centred around mitigating climate change. This is a fact. This is our great global challenge.
Politicians, academics, scientists, entrepreneurs, Canadians – we will all be seized with it.
So here’s the question you have to ask yourself: Do you want to be represented by a team that has a serious, ambitious plan, and is committed to doing more? 
Or do you want a team of climate change deniers, with no long-term vision for Canada’s environmental and economic future?
Conservatives want to take us backwards, and make pollution free again. This isn’t an exaggeration – they’ve told Canadians that that’s what they’ll do. 
They ignore climate change because they don’t think it’s an economic issue. But they couldn’t be more wrong. 
You pay for climate change when your basement floods.
Or when the highway washes out, and you can’t make it to your shift.
You pay for climate change when you’re facing higher insurance premiums.
Or when tourists skip your town because the smoke from neighbouring forest fires is too much.
You pay when a drought devastates your crops.
And you pay when deadly heat waves paralyze your city for days.
Climate change is already making life more expensive for Canadians. We have to take it seriously, and that starts with setting ambitious but essential goals, and outlining how we’re going to get there.
We’re not just investing in clean tech, and public transit, and climate resilient infrastructure – we’re investing in Canada’s future. We’re investing in our kids, and we’re investing in a better tomorrow.
Here’s the long and the short of it: Our plan creates jobs and reduces pollution. The Conservative plan will cost more and do less.
Doug Ford, Jason Kenney, Andrew Scheer. This generation of Conservative politicians are all the same when it comes to the environment. They just don’t care and they just don’t get it.
Our kids have some tough questions for us about climate change. The Conservatives don’t have any answers. We do. 
We have to do more. And we will. 
In this election, Canadians are faced with an important choice: will we move backwards, or will we stand together, and choose forward?
Here is our promise as Liberals: We won’t give tax breaks to the one percent or to big polluters, but we will make life more affordable and fight climate change.
That’s what we’re offering. A real plan for families, and for the future.
I’m for moving forward: for our planet, for our kids, for everyone.
Merci."

When I first ran for office more than a decade ago, I met parents who were worried about making ends meet. I talked to people who had worked hard their entire life, but were concerned about whether they would have enough to retire.
I got into politics because I believed it was time they had a government standing up for them, not one that was looking out for the wealthiest 1 percent. A government focused on the middle class and on helping people build a good life for themselves and their families.
That’s what we believe in. So it’s what we promised Canadians in 2015. And it’s what we’ve worked for every day since. Fighting for the middle class is about real people: people like you. 
We promised to be in your corner. To always keep working for families like yours, from coast to coast to coast.
Those parents I met a decade ago in Montreal who were worried about making ends meet? They now have more money in their pockets to help with everyday expenses.
The people who were up at night thinking about retirement? They can rest easier thanks to a more generous Canada Pension Plan.
That’s what politics should be about — helping people.
But even if making life better for the middle class sounds like a no-brainer, it’s not something we can take for granted. It’s something we have to keep fighting for, every day. 
We still have lots of work to do, and our kids, our neighbours, and our fellow Canadians are counting on us to keep moving forward.
When I talk to people from Toronto to Calgary to St. John’s, they’re concerned about being able to afford a home, and getting stuck in traffic.
They’re worried about climate change, and how fundamental rights are coming under attack.
Those are big challenges, but we’re not powerless. Together, we can decide to do something about it. Together, we can decide to keep building a better today and a brighter tomorrow.
Forward or backward. That’s an important choice to make, and I know where I stand.
I’m for choosing forward.

With eight weeks until Canadians head to the polls, Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party of Canada are launching an innovative new advertising and digital engagement campaign focused on the choice facing Canadians in October’s important election.





































A series of new national ads featuring Justin Trudeau will begin airing on television this week, as part of a comprehensive and digitally-integrated advertising experience that also includes a large-scale online campaign, a new website, and featured stories from Canadians who have a personal connection to Canada’s progress since 2015. It also includes the launch of the Liberal Party of Canada’s official 2019 campaign theme: Choose Forward.
“The Conservatives like to say they’re for the people, but then they cut taxes for the wealthy and cut services for everybody else. In October, we’ve got a choice to make: Keep moving forward and build on the progress we’ve made, or go back to the politics of the Harper years. I’m for moving forward — for everyone.”

These new ads mean that we’re able to share our message with more Canadians about the progress that you have made possible, and the clear choice at stake in this election.
But your support is crucial to keeping these ads on the air, and we need you to help us reach even more Canadians in these final 8 weeks before Election Day.

Check against delivery
August 21, 2019
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for your warm welcome, and thank you to Pierre and the folks at CORIM for having me here today.
In a few days, I’m heading to Biarritz, where I’ll meet with other G7 leaders to address today’s most pressing challenges.
So today, I want to offer a positive vision of Canada’s unique and multi-faceted role in an increasingly unpredictable era. One where we support the middle class, stand firm for our interests and values, and step up when others step back.
Ours is a country rooted in diversity and openness. We are a trading nation. Collaborative and influential, but not big enough to single-handedly dictate world affairs on our own.
For these reasons and more, Canadians directly benefit from global cooperation, multilateral institutions, and international relations governed by rules and principles.  
We’ve always understood that global issues affect Canadian interests, which is why having a voice in shaping the world is important. 
Over the last several decades, we’ve lived in a time when that’s not only possible, but expected.
It’s become easy to take the G7, the G20, the UN, NATO, the WTO, and other institutions for granted.
But let’s not forget how revolutionary the idea of global cooperation was in the wake of two world wars. 
The vision was of a connected world forged on the basis of respect for international law and human rights. One in which might is constrained by common principles and standards. One where economic growth provides a better present for many, and a brighter future for all.
Thankfully, this vision caught on. 
It has produced incredible results, and Canadians have played an important part throughout. Over the past four years as Prime Minister, I’ve had many varied conversations with Canadians, world leaders, experts, and the incredible professionals working in our diplomatic corps – and the one constant I’m hearing more and more often is that the world has changed, and quickly. 
2019 looks very different than 2015.
Citizens are losing faith that their leaders, their institutions, and their economic systems will deliver a brighter future for them. They struggle to believe that globalization benefits anyone other than the top one percent. 
More and more, countries are turning inward, succumbing to the easy but dangerous lure of populism and nationalism. They choose to blame foreigners for their domestic challenges, and retreat within their borders. 
And the result is a more unpredictable and unstable world, where some have chosen to step away from the mantle of international leadership, even as others challenge the institutions and principles that have shaped the international order.
That has a direct impact on today’s world.
Protectionism is on the rise, and trade has become weaponized.
Authoritarian leaders have been emboldened, leading to new forms of oppression. 
Calls for democratic reform, from Moscow to Caracas, are being supressed.
Crises that were once met with a firm international response are festering, becoming regional emergencies with global implications.
And all of this is making it more difficult to solve the problems that demand urgent global action.
Climate change is an existential threat to humanity, with science telling us we have just over a decade to find a solution for our planet.
And technological change is happening at an unprecedented rate, transcending borders, re-shaping our societies, and leaving many more anxious than ever. 
Our government has responded to this new world by rejecting populism, and restoring people’s confidence that their governments can work for them. 
As I said at the UN in 2016, “Fear has never fed a family, nor created a single job. And those who exploit it will never solve the problems that have created such anxiety.”
We understand that too many people feel left behind, and so in Canada, we are focusing on building an economy that works better for everyone. 
That means cutting taxes for the middle class, and giving parents more money to help raise their kids. It also means investing in the next generation, and uniting behind shared values.  
But we understand that these anxieties are not unique to Canadians.
That’s why we have driven the global conversation around middle class prosperity, including last year in Charlevoix, where the G7 agreed to a new commitment on equality and economic growth.
We have paved the way in making middle class growth not just a Canadian priority, but an international priority.
But we have also recognized that in this more unpredictable world, Canada will need to stand firm for our interests and values, and step up when others step back. 
Take our relationship with the United States as a good example of our approach.
To say that the United States is our closest ally is an understatement. Canada has long benefited from this relationship, and from American leadership in the world. We are friends and partners more than mere allies. 
We share more than just a border – we share culture, food, music, business. We share a rich history, and we share many of the same core values.
And so, we have relied on one another since the creation of our two distinct countries. This is not an accident of history. It reflects the conscious choice to pursue our common interests, while respecting our differences and resolving our disagreements through frank negotiation. 
So the change in the US administration, their approach to America’s role in the world, and their threat to rip up NAFTA presented a novel and serious challenge. 
But our government – including the brilliant and tenacious Chrystia Freeland – took a steady, reasoned approach from day one: we chose not to escalate needlessly, but stood firm for Canadian interests and refused to back down.
We were relentless in conveying to our American partners just what was on the line if we were all to suddenly wake up one morning without NAFTA in place. And it wasn’t just our governing team that put in the leg work – business leaders, unions and workers themselves, other orders of government, Indigenous groups, and ordinary Canadians stepped up.
Together, we formed one Team Canada.
And when the Americans put unfair 232 tariffs on our steel and aluminum exports, we reacted with dollar-for-dollar retaliation. 
By staying disciplined, focusing on our shared goals, and ignoring the Conservative Party’s insistence that we roll over and capitulate, we got the tariffs lifted, we renegotiated NAFTA, and we got the job done.
We are where we are today because we stood our ground, and didn’t walk away from the table.
We have secured free trade access to our largest and most essential partner, in an era of American protectionism.
Canadian steel and aluminum workers are no longer facing unfair tariffs.
Canada’s exports to the US are at a record high.
And we have done it all while maintaining a strong, constructive relationship with our American counterparts. 
That, my friends, is a win for Canada.
And let’s not forget that NAFTA wasn’t the only major trade deal we closed. 
We also negotiated CPTPP and CETA, securing market access across the Asia-Pacific and to Europe at precisely the moment in our history when trade diversification mattered most – a moment where the belief in the benefits of trade is under siege.
Canadians now have free trade access to two-thirds of the global economy. And Canada is the only G7 country with a free trade deal with every other G7 country.
Over the last four years, with NAFTA, CETA, and CPTPP, we got results while refusing to compromise our values. Because we know that free and fair trade is essential to our economic growth, but only if it delivers benefits for everyone. The old way of doing trade won’t work anymore.
The fact that trade creates growth is not in dispute – increased economic activity means more opportunities for businesses. The free flow of goods and services is a positive thing for economies. 
But simply assuming that the benefits of trade will make their way down to citizens is careless and wrong. And just hoping that trade won’t have adverse impacts on the environment, or labour, or cultural industries, or Indigenous peoples is an incorrect and dangerous assumption to make.
Trade hasn’t worked for everyone.
But that doesn’t mean we should close our borders and refuse to engage —we need to take a new approach. We need to shape deals that think beyond the single bottom line, and make a conscious effort to focus on people as much as on numbers. 
Free and fair trade must reflect the beliefs and values of Canadians. And making that case for trade is how citizens buy in to what we’re pursuing in their name. Showing we’re focused on delivering benefits for our kids and grandkids is how we get public support for trade, and helping people and industries who face disruption is an important part of that.
Failing to understand this new reality is naïve.  
In our recent trade negotiations, we have proven that being pragmatic, progressive, and principled gets results.
Take CPTPP and CETA – negotiations for both deals started under the Harper government, but stalled. It took our government, with a new approach and unparalleled levels of engagement, to close the deals.
With CPTPP, we moved ahead when the US withdrew, forging important new partnerships with growing economies in the Asia-Pacific, because the world’s economic centre of gravity is moving eastwards. Canada is now better positioned for the future of global economic growth. Not only that, we ended up with even stronger ties with longstanding allies like Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. 
With CETA, our government showed the Europeans that we understood that modern trade deals must benefit everyday people and respect the public interest, including on the environment. Canada made the case that if our EU partners couldn’t do a deal with us, a like-minded country with high standards and a progressive government, then with whom exactly could they sign a deal? I was invited to the French National Assembly where I made the case for trade. Meanwhile, some members of the opposition wrote letters urging legislators to vote against this important agreement.
In the end, CETA passed the vote. We are setting a new standard for trade that also represents a momentous shift forward in our historic friendship with Europe. This was the foundation for a significant deepening of ties, which we saw reflected when we hosted the Canada-EU Summit recently in Montreal.
And as for NAFTA, it is worth remembering that Conservative politicians slammed Canadian priorities, like setting better labour standards for workers and protecting the environment. But ironically for them, it will actually be those progressive elements that will help get the deal through a Democratic-majority Congress.
These were major successes with partners, new and old. But if global trade is to be sustainable and deliver benefits to everyone, it needs to be governed by rules and underpinned by institutions that work.
And so, Canada has stepped up to work with our partners on a pressing problem.
Canada convened a group of WTO members, known as the Ottawa Group, to help modernize this organization in its crucial role of facilitating international trade and resolving disputes. And while we seek to reform and strengthen the WTO, Canada is also working with the EU to establish a new appellate mechanism so that it will still be possible to arbitrate trade disputes in the meantime. 
On this, we can thank Jim Carr for his great work.
And Canada will need to show more of this kind of leadership in the years ahead, including on the environment.
Now, Conservative politicians continue to say that our focus on the environment – in trade deals and more generally – is misplaced. But what they don’t seem to understand is that Canadians are demanding action on climate change.
Climate change is an existential threat. The Conservative Party doesn’t understand that. But we shouldn’t be surprised.
Remember, Stephen Harper was awarded “Fossil of the Year” at the UN Climate Change Conference – several years in a row.
This wilful blindness to the threat of climate change contributed to the decline of Canada’s stature and influence worldwide. It hindered our ability to get energy infrastructure built, and threatened trade deals like CETA.
We need to be clear that climate change will shape relations between states in the decades ahead, and will only increase in impact. Most importantly, it will be the singular issue upon which future generations will judge us.
Our government understands the vital importance of addressing this problem. And we know that pollution isn’t bound by borders, so it’s crucial that we work with our allies to protect our planet.
Thanks to Minister McKenna’s leadership, we’ve achieved some incredible results.
Canada was a key driver of the Paris Agreement, a landmark pact signed by 195 countries with the express goal of fighting climate change.
When we hosted the G7 in Charlevoix last year, we put forward a world-leading Ocean Plastics Charter, which outlined concrete actions to tackle plastic pollution. This Charter has since been endorsed by 21 countries. Just a few months after Charlevoix, Canada co-hosted the Sustainable Blue Economy Conference, alongside Japan and Kenya.
And finally, while we phase out coal, ban harmful single-use plastics, protect our oceans, and put a price on pollution here at home, we’re also giving support in the billions of dollars for ambitious and essential climate action in developing countries.
Re-committing to the developing world is yet another way that we broke from the previous government’s approach to foreign policy.
We understand that a more stable, peaceful, and prosperous world is only possible if we offer a brighter future for all, including the most vulnerable.
That’s why we created a ground-breaking Feminist International Assistance Policy. Now, the majority of Canada’s aid dollars support the social, political, and economic empowerment of women. Because when women and girls succeed, economies grow and communities thrive. 
But in order to support those women and girls throughout their lives, we need to make sure they have access to the same education that so many take for granted.
This was a key focus when we held the G7 Presidency, and I’m very proud to say that by working with our partners, Canada was able to raise a historic $3.8 billion for the education of women and girls in crisis and conflict states.
At the same time, we recognize the vital importance of guaranteeing access to high quality health care.
We supported Prime Minister Harper’s efforts to expand maternal, child, and newborn health. But we also understood the need to expand this assistance in ways that recognized the full needs of women and girls. 
And on this, we have heavily relied on Minister Monsef.
And so, we hosted the 2019 Women Deliver Conference in Vancouver, the world’s largest conference on gender equality. There, we committed to raise our funding to $1.4 billion annually to support women and girls’ health around the world. Of that funding, $700 million per year will be dedicated to sexual and reproductive health and rights.
Whether it’s supporting the Thrive agenda and creating the Equality Fund, establishing FinDev Canada, or working with the private sector to build sustainable infrastructure, we understand the need to create new, innovative coalitions and tools for the modern era.
But let’s be clear – in this more unstable world, Canada must also be prepared to both defend ourselves and step up when called upon.
Our Minister of National Defence, Harjit Sajjan, understands this better than most.
We’ve made an historic investment in Canada’s hard power, increasing our defence budget by 70% so that our women and men in uniform have the equipment and training they need to operate at their very best.
This includes capabilities to better defend Canada and contribute to continental security. Recognizing the impact of both a changing climate and growing maritime traffic in the Arctic, we’re renewing our Coast Guard fleet, building Arctic Offshore Patrol Ships, and expanding satellite surveillance and remotely piloted systems. We’re also rebuilding and upgrading facilities, as well as better supplying the Canadian Rangers.
Compared to four years ago, we have more patrol ships, icebreakers, and light armoured vehicles on order. We have new search and rescue aircraft on the way. And after a decade of Conservative bungling, we have an RFP for Canada’s new fighter jet fleet – a fleet that will be 35% larger to better meet our needs and obligations.
We understand that protecting Canada doesn’t stop at our border. We make the greatest contribution to global stability when we match what Canada does best to what the world needs most. Our approach has been to focus on working in partnership, putting our unique Canadian expertise and capabilities on offer to build sustainable peace wherever we’re engaged. 
And contrary to the Harper government’s indifference – and even hostility – toward multilateral cooperation, we’ve chosen to not only re-engage in important bodies like NATO and the UN, but also take on a leadership role in their efforts. 
Alongside the US, UK, and Germany, we’re leading NATO’s defence of Europe’s Eastern flank through our battlegroup in Latvia. The Last year, I visited the troops stationed there and saw firsthand the key role that Canada is playing. 
And after contributing to the defeat of Daesh, Canada is helping Iraq rebuild and find sustainable peace, including by taking command for the first two years of NATO’s new training mission.
And we’ve undertaken these roles while continuing to stand strong with other partners like Ukraine.
Canada-Ukraine ties have never been stronger. We recently signed a new free trade agreement, and Canadian election observers, led by former Minister of Foreign Affairs Lloyd Axworthy, worked to protect the integrity of Ukraine’s last election. 
When Ukraine reached out for help in 2015, asking Canada to help train their troops, we stepped up. And we just recently expanded and extended the mission until 2022, because Canada will always defend Ukraine’s sovereignty. Russia’s aggression and illegal annexation of Crimea is completely unacceptable, and we will oppose it at every turn.
At the UN, we’ve chosen to re-engage in deliberate ways that will strengthen its ability to promote peace and security in the years ahead.
Over the past year, Canadian peacekeepers have been supporting a UN mission in Mali. Thanks to Canada, our partners have been able to access remote and vulnerable areas of the region, with the goal of delivering long-term peace and prosperity.
And we’ve also led the charge on advancing the UN’s Women, Peace, and Security agenda, and building support for the Vancouver Principles on child soldiers.
In a world of growing authoritarianism and instability, Canada has repeatedly stepped up to lead.
As a key player in the Lima Group, we’ve worked more closely than ever with our Latin American allies to defend democracy in Venezuela from the illegitimate Maduro regime. Earlier this year, Canada hosted the Lima Group, which produced the Ottawa Declaration for Venezuela, and has since been endorsed by nearly two dozen countries.
Concerned by the slow international response to the ongoing genocide of the Rohingya, Canada appointed former Premier Bob Rae as a Special Envoy to Myanmar. Special Envoy Rae has been a tireless advocate, and was instrumental in shaping Canada’s response, which includes more than $300 million in funding to address humanitarian needs, as well as promoting accountability for the crimes that have been committed.
Now, I’m not saying that we’re done, that we’ve solved the ills of the world. Nor am I saying that everything we’ve tried so far has worked. 
But in this new unpredictable era, we can’t refuse to try simply because the outcome isn’t guaranteed. 
We must find a way to make progress. 
Preserving the rules-based international order and adapting international institutions to our current reality means that Canada will need to work with a wide range of partners. 
Newly-influential players are asserting their place at the table with new approaches and new ideas. And we need their support to solve some of the world’s problems.
The challenge is to accommodate global change in a way that seeks common interests and seizes new opportunities, but also preserves fundamental international principles. 
Take China.
It is the world’s second largest economy, home to almost one and a half billion people. Our countries share a long history of diplomatic relations – 50 years next year, in fact. We have deep people to people ties, and we recognize real economic opportunities for Canadians. 
But we’ve also had our share of disagreements. We know well that China has a political system and core values that differ from ours. 
We are monitoring developments in Hong Kong closely and are mindful of the 300,000 Canadian citizens who are there. Alongside international partners, we have emphasized the need to exercise restraint and reject violence. Now is the time to engage in dialogue and respect fundamental freedoms, including the right to peaceful assembly.
Our government has been working tirelessly to secure the safe release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. This has included generating widespread support from the international community.
Canadians expect us to be unwavering in our commitment to human rights, while upholding the paramount importance of international treaties.
We are also very concerned about developments in Hong Kong. Alongside international partners, we call on local authorities to respect the rights of Hong Kong citizens to assemble peacefully. Now is the time to exercise restraint and listen to citizens. 
As a global community, we must recognize that China is a growing power and increasingly assertive towards its place in the international order. But make no mistake: we will always stand firm for Canadian interests. 
Canada has a long history of dealing directly and successfully with larger partners. We do not escalate, but we also don’t back down. 
And there are, of course, other pressing issues that demand our attention.
White supremacy, Islamophobia, and anti-Semitism are an increasing scourge around the world, and at home.
Gender equality is backsliding.
Human rights are increasingly under threat.
This is the world we’re in. And so we cannot lose sight of our core values. That means being prepared to speak up, and knowing that sometimes doing so comes at a cost. But when the courage of our convictions demands it, so be it.
Ultimately, Canada’s credibility and influence depends on our partners knowing who we are and what we stand for. 
Let me give you just a few examples of this approach in action.
Out of our entire community of nations, it is Israel whose right to exist is most widely – and wrongly – threatened. On this, we have always been clear: Canada is a steadfast friend of Israel. At the same time, mutual understanding and progress through peaceful negotiation is more important than ever. That’s why we continue to stand for a two-state solution. 
On LGBTQ2 rights, we were proud to recently serve as co-chair of the Equal Rights Coalition alongside Chile. With 42 member states, this organization works to advance the rights of LGBTQ2 people around the world. 
And while the Conservatives blocked the implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, we stood in front of the UN General Assembly to talk about how we must do better for Indigenous peoples in Canada.
Ladies and gentlemen, a world of populism, uncertain leadership, and global challenges is a world in which Canadians have important choices to make.
Conservative politicians are once again relying on the politics of division, including here in Canada.
They envision a world where Canada ignores the reality of climate change – just last week, the former Conservative Finance Minister, Joe Oliver, said that climate change is a great thing for Canada. He should try telling that to Canadian families who have lost their homes due to flooding or forest fires.
They envision a world where they deny critical support for vulnerable and marginalized women by refusing to fund sexual and reproductive health and rights. Where skepticism about international cooperation leads to Canada’s retreat from institutions like the UN.
The Conservatives envision a world where Canada hectors from the sidelines – where we refuse to participate, but still expect a platform from which to shout.
They envision a world where Canada flirts with the forces of populism, whipping up fear and spreading misinformation. 
They criticize without abandon, but haven’t actually offered up alternatives when asked what they’d do differently.
But this much is clear: their approach to foreign policy will leave Canada diminished on the world stage. It will be a return to the Harper era, where Canada does less, and matters less.
But there is also a forward-looking, positive vision on offer, based on the success of the last four years. One that understands the anxieties driving international instability, the importance of Canadian leadership in a more unpredictable world, and the imperative to solve fundamental global challenges.
In the years ahead, Canada should place democracy, human rights, international law, and environmental protection at the very heart of foreign policy. We have long believed in these principles, but are now called upon to do more to defend them, both because it is right and because it is in our national interest.
A world with more authoritarian states, less respect for human rights, and weaker international rules is a world where Canada is worse off, has fewer friends, and faces greater threats. 
Still, over this past four years, we’ve accomplished a lot in this uncertain world. But there’s more we need do to advance Canadian interests, and Canada’s place on the international stage.
Here’s some of what I’d like to see happen next.
We need find ways to make the full breadth of Canadian expertise available to countries seeking to democratize, advance justice, and build stronger, better, and more transparent governments.
We should stand side by side with those who put themselves at risk in the defence of democracy and pursuit of peace, and be prepared to offer refuge when they face persecution abroad. 
We need to make it easier for small and medium-sized Canadian businesses to engage in trade, and do the constant hard work to ensure that all Canadians benefit from trade. 
As some step back from global leadership, we should work with others to mobilize international efforts, particularly by ensuring the most vulnerable and marginalized have access to the health and education they need. 
Canadians have found strength in diversity and benefited from openness to the world. Financial strain should never hold Canadians back from exploring the world or building positive connections abroad, especially when it comes to young people and seniors.
I look forward to saying more soon on these proposals and others. 
Ladies and gentlemen, in three days, the countries of the G7 will meet in France. The state of the world and concerns about the global economy will be at the top of our agenda. 
My message will be clear.
We need to invest in an economic future that benefits everyone, and focus on helping the middle class. We need to work to ensure that international relations and international trade is governed by predictable rules and principles. And we must never forget that peace and prosperity comes when governments listen to and serve their citizens. 
That’s the Canadian approach.
We are a proud liberal democracy, and a vibrant multicultural society. We value human rights, equality, and economic opportunity.
We know that newcomers strengthen our communities. 
We know that trade should be free and fair, while also reflecting our values. 
We know that securing our national interests demands that we step up to deal with international issues.
We know that we Canadians can punch well above our weight when it comes to preserving peace and security. 
We know that climate change is the most pressing of many problems requiring global solutions. 
And we know that a strong and thriving middle class is the most effective bulwark against destructive populism. 
My friends, that is the Canada our allies know. 
That is the Canada I am so proud to serve.
And that is the Canada that this turbulent world needs us to be.
Thank you."

I’m proud to be part of a team that’s making real progress on women’s rights, equality, and economic success. And that progress is important not only for women, but for all Canadians.
By taking real action to advance gender equality and increase women’s participation in the workforce, our economy will be able to unlock an entirely new level of growth and potential.
Our Liberal government is supporting women entrepreneurs, newcomer women, and women in the trades, and taking concrete steps to encourage women and girls to pursue careers in STEM fields. We’re standing up for women’s rights and ensuring that all Canadian women have access to safe and legal reproductive and abortion services. And just this past month, our Liberal government announced that we would be supporting the new Equality Fund – making Canada the single largest investor in women’s rights organizations both at home and around the world.
That’s what real progress looks like.
And while Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives stand in opposition to women’s fundamental human rights – 12 Conservative MPs were at last month’s anti-choice ‘March for Life’ rally – the Liberal team is focused on making real progress and ensuring we’re ready to defend the rights and equality of all Canadians at every opportunity.
We must continue to find solutions, to break barriers, to push back against the push back, and to take action to advance gender equality. I’m counting on your support to help continue building on our important work.
With less than 4 months until Election Day, our teams are gearing up to run competitive campaigns across the country and help protect this progress, and so much more. Because when it comes to continuing to build a better and more inclusive future for all Canadians, there is much more work ahead of us than behind us!

CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY
Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for being here, as we announce an important decision.
In 2015, we were elected on a promise to Canadians. We made a commitment to make real change happen in this country, and grow the middle class. We also committed to building a real plan to protect our environment and fight climate change.
We do not see these goals as irreconcilable. We seem them as complementary.
You can’t have a real economic plan, a real jobs plan, in the 21st century unless you have a real climate change plan. We want good middle class jobs now, and good middle class jobs for our kids.
To do that, we need to create wealth today so we can invest in the future. We need to invest in Canadians so they can take advantage of the opportunities generated by a rapidly changing economy, here at home and around the world.
The policies of the last century will not serve Canadians well in this one.
That’s the approach we take in everything we do, including decisions we make about resource development.
In 2016, we announced an approval for the Trans Mountain expansion project.
The Trans Mountain Pipeline has been in operation for more than 65 years. We approved the twinning of that pipeline – so, running a single additional pipe alongside the one that’s already there.
This project has the potential to create thousands of solid middle-class jobs for Canadians. People in BC, Alberta, and right across the country would have more opportunities to earn a good living.
That’s what we’ve worked hard to do since the day we took office, supporting Canadians as they work hard to create jobs and build our communities.
And our plan is working.
It’s helped Canadians create over a million jobs, and lifted 825,000 Canadians out of poverty.
Creating jobs, creating the conditions so people can get ahead – that’s been our focus every day, and it’s an important lens through which we view project proposals like TMX.
We also believe that TMX could solve a core economic challenge we currently face.
It’s really simple: right now we basically have only one customer for our energy resources – the United States. And as we’ve seen over the past few years, anything can happen with our neighbours to the south.
Now, don’t get me wrong. Americans are strong friends, partners, and allies.
But Canadians are our own people, and we make our own choices. But we can only make choices when we have choices. Right now, when it comes to our conventional energy, we do not.
We have only one customer.
99% of our conventional energy is sold to the United States, often at large discounts.
Every businessperson knows that when you have a single customer, you’re in a weaker position. You’re vulnerable to that customer’s desires, and to changes in their market and policy orientation.
We don’t think that’s an acceptable situation for Canada.
Canadians understand – now more than ever – that we need to diversify to new markets. And when it comes to moving our oil across land, pipelines are safer than rail.
So, when Kinder Morgan decided to pull out of the project, our government stepped in.
Now, things have changed since the big projects of our distant past. We can’t just decide to build a railway one day, and start laying track the next.
And that’s a good thing.
We have a duty to consult, and do things the right way. Because doing them the old way gets nothing done – just ask the Conservative government that preceded us.
That’s exactly what the Federal Court of Appeal told us last August. For this pipeline to be considered, they said, we needed to do better.
And you know what? They were right. So here’s what we did.
We directed the National Energy Board to examine the impacts TMX could have on the marine environment, and provide recommendations.
We doubled the size of our consultation teams, and re-initiated Phase 3 consultations with Indigenous communities. This work was overseen by former Supreme Court Justice Frank Iacobucci.
Minister Sohi personally met with over 65 Indigenous groups across 46 meetings. And on that, I’d like to thank the Minister, and all Indigenous communities, for their participation in, and commitment to, this process.
At the end of the day, we listened. And we are acting on what we heard.
Indigenous communities said more needed to be done to protect and restore salmon habitat in the Fraser River.
They told us they wanted a seat at the table, and better information, in managing activities affecting the Salish Sea, and the project route.
They asked that we build on our efforts to protect the Southern Resident Killer Whale and its habitat.
They said they needed to be better equipped to deal with any kind of marine incident – that included co-developing a role for Indigenous communities in marine response.
We listened to community concerns and are acting on community ideas.
We’re working with Indigenous peoples to co-develop real accommodation measures to make our environment, our coast, and our communities safer, healthier, and better protected than ever before.
We have approached this decision with an open mind from the very beginning. And now, it’s time to take the next step.
Today, I’m announcing that our government has newly approved the Trans Mountain expansion project going forward.
The company plans to have shovels in the ground this construction season.
We’ve also been listening carefully to Canadians, and hearing about their desire for a cleaner future.
That’s why we’ve decided that every dollar the federal government earns from this project will be invested in Canada’s clean energy transition.
Additional corporate tax revenue alone could be around $500 million per year once the project is up and running.
We will invest this money, as well as any profits from the sale of the pipeline, in the clean energy projects that will power our homes, businesses, and communities for generations to come.
And finally, we will be launching a new phase of engagement to seek input from Indigenous groups on ways that they could directly share in the benefits of this project.
It could be an equity stake, or revenue sharing, or something else altogether. We’re coming to the table with an open mind.
And when it comes to potential Indigenous buy-in, we’re not putting a limit on it. Indigenous ownership in Trans Mountain Corporation could be 25 percent, 50 percent, or even 100 percent.
These are conversations that we’re excited to have.
By moving forward with TMX, we’re creating jobs, opening new markets, accelerating our clean energy transition, and generating new avenues for Indigenous economic prosperity.
Now, I know some people are disappointed by this decision.
I understand your disappointment.
And I know that for some, your concerns are very tangible.
To British Columbians who worry about a spill, for example, know that we take those concerns very seriously. I lived in Vancouver when I was a teacher, and I have deep BC roots. I understand your desire to protect the coastline and ocean, because I share it.
Our top priority is making sure there’s no spill in the first place. But we know we need to be prepared for anything.
After ten years of cuts under Stephen Harper, we’ve reinvested in the Canadian Coast Guard. With new vessels, new environmental response equipment, and new stations on the west coast – including the re-opening of the Kitsilano coast guard base – our professionals have never been more ready to respond in the unlikely event of a spill.
With this decision, Canadians might ask how I can square being a climate leader, while also building a pipeline.
It’s a fair question.
Here’s my answer:
First, there are the facts. This project isn’t about expanding our production. It’s about expanding our options. TMX will reduce our reliance on our single customer, the United States, and give us access to the growing markets of Asia.
But I know that question is about more than the facts. It’s about our priorities as a government. And yes, about mine personally as Prime Minister.
I believe those priorities are clear, and they are clearly different from the choice the Conservatives offer.
We’ve spent the last four years doing more for our environment than any other government in Canada’s history.
Putting a price on pollution, safeguarding our oceans, investing in public transit, reducing plastic pollution, supporting clean tech, expanding electric vehicle incentives…
And there’s a lot more to be done, for sure. I look forward to talking about our plan for the next four years in the election campaign this fall.
So to those who want sustainable energy, and a cleaner environment, know that I want that too.
But in order to bridge the gap between where we are and where we’re going, we need money to pay for it.
Canada is blessed with natural resources, and with that comes major responsibility.
As the world transitions to a cleaner economy, there will be demand for our existing resources. And there are hundreds of thousands of good jobs that currently depend on that demand.
The truth is, it doesn’t make environmental or economic sense to sell any resource at a discount.
Instead, we should take advantage of what we have, and invest the profits in what comes next, building the clean energy future that is already at our doorstep.
Fundamentally, this isn’t a choice between producing more conventional energy, or less. It’s a choice about where we can sell it, and how we get it there safely. We strongly believe that having more options, and more markets, puts Canada in a stronger strategic position to create good middle class jobs, and invest in our shared future.
That is why we made this decision.
Our energy workers, especially those in Alberta, have been hurting for far too long. And that’s because the last government couldn’t get a pipeline built to non-US markets, even though they were in power for a decade.
The Conservatives under Stephen Harper tried, and failed. They had ten years to get the job done, and they couldn’t.
And that’s because the Conservatives are stuck in the past. They bring last century’s solutions to this century’s problems.
They think we can ignore Indigenous people, and brush aside legitimate environmental concerns.
This is not rhetoric. It’s their record, and it’s still their policy.
In ten years, the Conservatives built exactly zero pipelines to new markets, but they did manage to build one thing: extreme animosity between those who want pipelines, and those who don’t.
And today, we see that they have learned nothing from that experience.
They wanted us to bulldoze our way ahead on TMX, even after the Federal Court of Appeal told us we couldn’t.
They’re fine with dividing Canadians and pitting provinces against each other.
But we’re focused on getting the best result for all Canadians.
Because the national government doesn’t just serve small segments of Canadian society, or those with the loudest voices or the deepest pockets. Our job is to serve everyone.
That’s the difference between us and the Conservatives: we listen to all perspectives. We make changes whenever possible. And we know that there’s no greater solution than the one built on compromise.
The economy is changing rapidly, here and around the world. The old ways won’t serve Canadians well today, let alone tomorrow. Creating new middle class jobs means having an economic plan built for the 21st century.
We have that plan, and the record speaks for itself. Over one million new jobs, and 825,000 Canadians lifted out of poverty since 2015, including nearly 300,000 kids.
These results didn’t happen by accident, and they’re on the ballot this fall.
Take a look at my record, and you’ll see that I’ve talked about the importance of developing our resources for a long time.
In 2013, I gave a speech at the Calgary Petroleum Club, where I said, “It remains a fundamental role of the Government of Canada to get Canadian resources to new markets, at home and abroad.”
But in that same speech, I said that in order to get the job done, Canada needed to have its act together on the environment.
Well, six years later, I believe that just as strongly today as I did then.
My friends, we are a government that cares deeply about the environment.
And we care just as deeply about the economic success of Canadians.
Contrary to what some politicians will tell you, this isn’t an either/or proposition. It is in Canada’s national interest to protect our environment and invest in tomorrow, while making sure people can feed their families today.
By moving forward with the Trans Mountain expansion, and investing the profits in our clean energy future, we’re doing exactly that.
Environment and economy.
Good middle class jobs.
This is how Canada will succeed – now, and into the future.
Thank you."

Canadians waited 416 days for a real climate change plan from Andrew Scheer. Instead, it’s a fake climate plan that won’t actually do anything to protect the environment.
Canadians want a government that takes climate change seriously, and the Liberal Party is the only party that has a real and affordable plan to fight climate change and protect a clean environment.
But don’t just take our word for it – here’s what Canadians are saying so far:

  “This is a plan only an oil lobbyist could love. It checks all the key boxes on the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers’ wish list and if it ever became federal policy it would deepen the climate crisis.”

By repealing the carbon tax, Andrew Scheer is taking away the best and lowest cost way to fight climate change.  It’s like trying to build a house without a hammer. @CleanProsperity's full statement on Andrew Scheer's proposed #climate plan: https://t.co/Xd3YsPCsM2

The Liberal Party of Canada is launching a significant new advertising campaign as the 2019 election approaches, highlighting how Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team are the only party that will stand up for middle class families.












New french-language national advertising featuring Justin Trudeau is now airing in heavy rotation on television across Québec and online across Canada, accompanied by a series of radio ads from Liberal MPs that are also airing in every part of Québec. New billboards are also being placed on major routes leading to the new Samuel-de-Champlain Bridge, as a reminder of how Liberals took a stand for middle class families and removed the tolls that the Conservatives had planned for it.
“Since 2015, Justin Trudeau and our Liberal team have stood up for middle class families. After 10 years of Stephen Harper’s failed policies left the middle class falling behind, we’ve been making real progress – with one million new jobs created, more money for families, and real action to protect our environment. But there’s so much more to do, and we will never stop working hard to build a better future.”
Pablo RodriguezQuébec Campaign Co-Chair and M.P. for Honoré-Mercier
Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team have a real plan to strengthen the middle class, grow the economy, and make life better for Canadian families. By introducing the Canada Child Benefit, lowering taxes for the middle class and raising them on the wealthiest 1 percent, putting a national price on pollution, and protecting middle class jobs with the new NAFTA, Justin Trudeau has been taking a stand for Canadians – but there’s so much more to do, and we can’t let the Conservatives take us back to the failed policies of Stephen Harper.
“This fall, Quebecers and all Canadians will have a clear choice to make. While Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team are focused on investing in the middle class, Andrew Scheer is focused on austerity and cutting vital services, just like Stephen Harper.”
Diane LebouthillierQuébec Campaign Co-Chair and M.P. for Gaspésie—Les Îles-de-la-Madeleine
These new ads mean that we’re able to share our message with more Canadians about the progress that you have made possible, and the clear choice at stake in this election.
But your support is crucial to keeping these ads on the air (and more!), and we need you to help us reach even more Canadians in these final 4 months before Election Day.
Can you chip in now towards the Re-election Fund, and help Justin Trudeau and our Liberal team earn another mandate from Canadians this fall?

Yesterday, the Liberal government unveiled Budget 2019, outlining the next steps in the Liberal team’s plan to invest in a strong middle class and build a better future for all Canadians.
We’re taking the next steps in our plan by investing in affordable housing and support for first-time home buyers, moving forward on implementing National Pharmacare, introducing the Canada Training Benefit, and making retirement more financially secure for Canadians.
The Liberal team’s work has been making real progress in the lives of Canadians. Canadians have created more than 900,000 new jobs since 2015, the unemployment rate is near a 40-year low, pollution is no longer free, and 9 out of 10 Canadian families with kids are getting more money thanks to the Canada Child Benefit.
But don’t just take our word for it – here’s what they’re saying about Budget 2019:

  “The commitment to an evidence-based formulary and collective drug price negotiations announced in today’s budget represent an important step forward on the part of the government.”
Dr. Danyaal RazaChair, Canadian Doctors for Medicare[Source]


  “In supporting access to medication, the new centralized drug agency will have a welcome role in reducing drug prices and establishing a formulary for Canadians. Along with a significant investment in medication for rare diseases, the key pillars are in place for a national approach to pharmacare.”

Today, Justin Trudeau offered condolences in the House of Commons on the terrorist attack in New Zealand.



Check against delivery
Mr. Speaker,
Before we begin, our hearts go out to the people of Utrecht and the Netherlands, who are reeling in the aftermath of a tram shooting. It’s in the early stages, but we do know that there are fatalities, and a number of injuries. Police are looking at it as a possible terrorist incident.
We stand with our Dutch friends as they grapple with the consequences of this violence, and we will be reaching out to our counterparts to offer our unwavering support.
Prime Minister Rutte addressed this House mere months ago, and he spoke of the close ties between our countries. Canada will be there for the Netherlands in the difficult days ahead.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express Canada’s deepest condolences to all those grieving in New Zealand.
Just a few days ago, our friend and ally suffered the worst terrorist attack in their history. An attack motivated by Islamophobia. Fifty men, women, and children murdered at prayer. Dozens injured. Gunned down by a monster. A terrorist. A coward.
I spoke with Prime Minister Ardern to express Canada’s deepest sympathy and support, and praised her compassionate leadership in the wake of this tragedy.
Our hearts ache for the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, partners and friends who never had the chance to say goodbye to their loved ones. Loved ones killed by a hateful individual who ascribed to a hateful ideology.
Mr. Speaker, Canada is home to over a million Muslims who live and thrive in a free and open, secular democracy. It is our responsibility to maintain this freedom, so that those who choose to practice faith can do so without fear of violence.
To our Muslim friends here in Canada, in New Zealand, and around the world, know that we mourn with you. We feel your pain, and we love you. We will stand by you in the difficult days and weeks to come.
The Qur’an tells us: ‘the true servants of the Most Merciful are those who behave gently and with humility on earth, and whenever the foolish quarrel with them, they reply with words of peace.’
Now, if that idea sounds familiar, perhaps you’ve also heard it in the Gospel of Matthew, which speaks not of revenge and retaliation, but of turning the other cheek. Indeed, if we choose to look for them, the lessons found within our faiths will bind us together, and are more powerful than those things that seek to divide us.
Just two years ago, I stood at a vigil for six innocent men in Ste. Foy, Quebec. Brothers, fathers, and sons who, like the victims of Christchurch, were gunned down during prayer. I mourned with the families, who couldn’t believe that such hatred could touch their community.
Mr. Speaker, the tragedies in Ste. Foy and in Christchurch are ones we’ve seen too many times before. Innocent people are killed. Headlines blare out as nations grapple with chaos and violence. Mass shootings. Faith-based slaughter. Terrorist attacks.
It is shameful, and sadly, the leaders of the world bear some responsibility. Responsibility we can no longer ignore by simply pointing fingers. Because, in this day and age, those that seethe the loudest are given a larger platform than ever before.
Toxic rhetoric has broken into the mainstream. It’s anti-Semitic. Islamophobic. Anti-black. Anti-Indigenous. Misogynistic. Homophobic. The list goes on and on.
This rhetoric is dangerous, hateful, and vile. It lives and festers online, spilling out into the real world with deadly consequences.
We see it here in Canada, in online harassment, anonymous letters, defaced places of worship, acts of violence, and even murder.
When we fail to denounce hatred with total conviction, we empower those people and legitimize their violence.
Mr. Speaker, over the years, we’ve seen an increase in the number of terrorist attacks targeting Muslims all around the world. So, families flee to democracies like Canada, and the United States, and our allies, praying that their new homes will give them safety. Hoping that their kids will know a place where they are not targeted because of faith.
But sadly, Mr. Speaker, these same families who fled violence in their homelands are now too often met by a new kind of violence when they reach new shores. Anti-immigrant hatred. Right-wing extremism. White nationalism. Neo-Nazi terrorism.
These groups are alive in Canada – a nation that, under the leadership of Laurier, and Diefenbaker, and my father, has long championed the protection of minorities, and promoted our diversity as our greatest strength.
And yet, while the majority of our citizens welcome these newcomers with open arms, small, toxic segments peddle the belief that greater diversity is a weakness. The irony is that these fringe groups say they despise Daesh, Al-Qaida, Boko Haram, and others. But they spew hatred, and incite violence, and murder the innocent just the same. They are no better than those they claim to hate.
Mr. Speaker, the problem is not only that politicians routinely fail to denounce this hatred – it’s that, in too many cases, they actively court those who spread it.
To politicians and leaders around the world: the dog whistle politics, the ease with which certain people choose to adopt extremist ideology – it has to stop.
It’s not that people are dying. It’s that people are being killed. Mothers and fathers, ripped from their families. Carefree, innocent children gunned down in the blink of an eye, without an ounce of reticence. Mosques. Temples. Synagogues. Churches. Concerts. Malls. Schools. People murdered while vulnerable and defenseless – here in Canada, south of the border, around the world.
And the response is always the same. We’re aghast as the headlines blare, and moms and dads hug their kids a little tighter, and thank God it’s not happening to them.
Politicians stand around, and we offer our condolences, and we say nice things in the aftermath. We say that we’ll do better. We say that never again will such hatred be allowed to fester unchallenged. And then, when the flames die down, and the smoke clears, we look the other way. We revert back to politicking, figuring out how we can tap into that powerful rage to harness a few more votes. We scapegoat the “other” to play to our base. With a wink and a nudge, we legitimize this evil.
Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to cast a light on this hatred, and on our unwillingness to call it out. As leaders, as privileged few with power and an audience, we have a responsibility to do something. This responsibility is not negotiable. It’s not to be waived when it’s politically convenient.
Courting these views is always the wrong choice to make. We have to chase out this hatred from our parties, fight it online, denounce it at town halls, push back when it reaches our front door. Choosing to stay silent, while hatred stews, is complicity in its most cowardly form.
Mr. Speaker, year after year, decade after decade, we mourn the loss of X number of people, in X country, and we vow to do better. But then we repeat the cycle, as leaders decide that hatred is an emotion worth exploiting, and they ride to power on the back of insatiable anger. As a society, as a global community, as human beings, have we learned nothing?
To be honest, I’m tired of this. I’m tired of passing on our “thoughts and prayers”. But, as tired as I am, I can’t even begin to imagine how it must feel for those who are affected by this kind of violence every single day.
People around the world are exhausted by the carnage. They reach out to console friends and neighbours when these tragedies rock their communities, incensed by their leaders’ inability to take a principled stand. People come out to vigils, and plead for action, and we fall short. Our communities set an example that our leaders consistently fail to follow. After tragedies like these, politicians often say that it’s not a time to talk politics, but that instead we should grieve and support the affected communities.
I think that’s a farce. This is exactly the time to talk politics. Because the best way to support people is to acknowledge that there’s a problem, and take concrete steps to fix it.
Mr. Speaker, we as a global society have a choice to make. Will we call out our leaders, who turn a blind eye to those who incite violence? Will we call out our co-workers, who tell racist or misogynistic jokes, unchallenged? Will we call out the online trolls – those cowards who spew hatred, launching their vitriol behind a shield of anonymity? Ultimately, Mr. Speaker, will we do the right thing? Or will we bury our heads in the sand now, only to bury them in our hands later?
The tragedy in New Zealand is, sadly, another example of just how far we’ve gone astray. But we cannot let the lessons of those 50 deaths go unlearned. The path we’re going down is dangerous and unsustainable. People are tired of fighting this alone, without the backing of their leaders.
But we can take a stand, here and now, in Canada and around the world, to say that enough is enough. That the days of spewing hatred and inciting violence without consequence are over. We owe it to the people of Christchurch. We owe it to the people of Ste. Foy, and Pittsburgh, and Manchester. Mr. Speaker, we owe it to our kids, and we owe it to ourselves.
I’m calling on like-minded countries of the world to stand with Canada in this fight. Muslim, Christian, Jewish, black, white, all of us – we must fight this hatred as a team. A team that refuses to accept this as the new normal. A team tired of sending “thoughts and prayers”.
Here in Canada, we’ve already taken important steps to fight discrimination and hatred. We’ve stepped up our investigations into extreme hate groups, including white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups. We’ve made meaningful reforms around gun control. We increased funding for security at places of worship. And we’re investing in programs that foster inclusion, build bridges, and celebrate our diversity.
And still, we know that there is much more work to do. But make no mistake, we will do what needs to be done. And we will bring this message to the international stage.
To our partners around the world, the fight against racism and intolerance will be a major fight. But we can’t put it off any longer. I know that we can make real change here. We can turn the page, and get off this dangerous path we’re on. We need only look to our communities for inspiration.
Mr. Speaker, there are more good people than bad in this world. The light outweighs the dark, the good greatly outnumbers the evil. We see it when our citizens come together at vigils in the wake of tragedy. We see it when strangers link arms to protect places of worship. We see it in offers to walk with those who feel unsafe. We saw in in Ste. Foy, and we’re seeing it now in New Zealand. This is an important fight.
I’m calling on politicians of all stripes to follow the example set by the good people we serve, and do the right thing. We must counter this hatred. And together, we will.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker."

I first got involved with the Outremont riding association many years ago to bring forward our vision of a more inclusive, sustainable, and progressive Canada. Soon after, I became National Legal Adviser for the party – and a Team Trudeau candidate in 2015. Now, I’ll be joining the Liberal team in Ottawa to continue on that mission as a new Member of Parliament.
With hope, hard work, and an incredible team of volunteers, we earned the trust of our community and flipped Outremont red for the first time in a decade. We made history together, too – with Liberals electing more women in a single mandate of by-elections than any party ever has before.
Every day, more women are taking on leadership roles in our democracy. During the campaign, I had the opportunity to meet so many inspiring women, some working as innovators at the forefront of their industries, others pushing the boundaries of their fields, bettering their communities, and taking on roles that women didn’t have the opportunity to take on in previous generations.
Hard work pays off in Canada. Dedication makes a difference. And no matter the roadblocks, if you never give up, this country will help you make something of yourself.
That’s the kind of Canada I believe in, and that’s why I am proud to be part of the Liberal team. This team is working hard to empower Canadian women by allowing parents to share parental leave more equally, with a new Parental Sharing Benefit which supports women at home and in the workplace. We’re taking real action to end the gender wage gap, and support the leadership of women in Canada’s economy. And we are investing to create more opportunities for women in STEM fields – where women are changing the game, creating jobs, and building a more innovative future for all of us.
Together, we must continue to push for progress, because when women succeed, everyone benefits.
By supporting the next generation of women leaders, entrepreneurs, and creators, we lift up families, communities and economies – and to keep moving forward with our progress, we definitely need to keep electing more women to Parliament, too.
That’s why the Liberal team supports Liberal women seeking office and their campaigns with the specially-dedicated Judy LaMarsh Fund, with the next election now less than eight months away, we’re counting on you to help invest in it.
Support the Judy LaMarsh Fund by chipping in now and help elect more women to Parliament this fall!

There is no issue more important to our future than climate change.
That’s why this week I took the stage at our first rally of 2019 – our Climate Action Rally in Toronto – to speak with Canadians about our strong plan to protect a clean environment while growing our economy.
While Andrew Scheer has no plan at all, our plan is supported by leading scientists and economists across Canada. It makes polluters pay and gives the money back to people – and in Ontario for example, where we hosted this week’s rally, that means over three hundred dollars this year to the average family of four.
Across Canada, our children and grandchildren are counting on us to take action now. And that’s exactly what we’re doing.
Pollution is no longer free, we’re taking real action to protect Canada’s environment and coasts, and Canadians have created nearly 900,000 new jobs since 2015.
We’ve made incredible progress together, and our plan is working for Canadians – but there’s much more hard work ahead of us than behind us.
We’re in this together. Add your name now to show your support for real action to fight climate change:

The holiday season is both a time of reflection and a chance to look forward, and I’m so grateful for the real progress that you’ve made possible this year with your dedication and support.
Canadians have now created more than 800,000 new jobs since November 2015, and unemployment is at a 40-year low. This year, we successfully negotiated a new NAFTA – and got a good deal for Canada so Canadians can continue to count on well-paying jobs, and businesses can continue to expand and thrive.
The Canada Child Benefit will now provide even more support for Canadian families to help with the high costs of raising kids. Taxes are now lower for the middle class and small businesses, and the typical Canadian family of four will be $2,000 better off.
Meanwhile, we’re moving forward with an effective plan to protect a clean environment for future generations while growing our economy.
When it comes to ensuring that all Canadians can count on a real and fair chance at success, there’s still much more hard work ahead of us than behind us – but it’s clear that your hope and hard work is adding up to some pretty incredible results.
For that – and for everything you do to support real change – I want to thank you.
And we have an important date coming up. As you know, 2019 is an election year – and Canadians are counting on us to continue delivering on our vision of a better, stronger, more inclusive Canada.
Just 14 days into December, we know that the Conservatives are fundraising hard and gearing up to roll back the real progress we’ve been making for Canadians. By working together like we did in 2015, and like we always do, we won’t let that happen.

The Liberal government is focused on delivering real change for our middle class, investing in Canadians and making sure that everyone has a real and fair chance to succeed. With yesterday’s Fall Economic Statement, delivered by Bill Morneau, it’s clear that our plan to grow the economy is getting results.
More than half a million new full time jobs. Unemployment at a 40-year low. Increased wages. Lower taxes for the middle class and small businesses. Making Canada the most globally connected economy in the world. More support for strong and independent Canadian journalism, and a new Social Finance Fund.
We know there’s still much more work to do, and the Liberal government is continuing to build on the promises made in 2015 to strengthen the middle class and grow the economy.
But don’t just take our word for it – here’s what they’re saying:

  “By taking concrete action now to make Canada a more attractive place to invest and do business, the government can set the stage for stronger growth, higher middle-class incomes and a better future for Canadians of all ages, abilities and backgrounds. Economic growth drives the tax revenues that are required to pay for health care, hospitals, schools and other services that are essential to a healthy and productive society.”
Goldy HyderPresident and CEO, Business Council of Canada[Source]


  “The creation of a Social Finance Fund is an important first step towards a social innovation and social finance strategy for Canada that will accelerate innovative solutions to our most complex social challenges.  We welcome the government’s commitment to strengthening social investment and readiness.”
Michael ToyeExecutive Director, Canadian Community Economic Development Network


  “The new labour tax credit for local journalism is what’s been needed to help save local news.”

  “This fiscal update shows that the Federal Government is taking the right steps to increase the competitiveness and efficiency of Canada’s agricultural sector…It is very heartening to see the government is listening to farmers and, more importantly, acting on what they hear.”
Ron BonnettPresident, Canadian Federation of Agriculture[Source]


  “Democracy needs reporters working their beats to produce original news, so tax measures to relieve labour costs are critical in today’s disrupted news environment, And allowing philanthropy to fund non-profit news organizations introduces an important new source of financing for quality journalism.”
Edward GreensponPresident and CEO, Public Policy Forum

Canadians know pollution isn’t free. That’s why Justin Trudeau and the Liberal team have a real plan to protect a clean environment while growing our economy, and it’s working.
Our emissions are going down, and good middle class jobs are being created for Canadians. While Andrew Scheer’s Conservatives have no plan, experts agree that a price on pollution is one of the best tools we have to fight climate change and grow the economy.
But don’t just take our word for it – here’s what they’re saying:

  “Pollution isn’t free. Pricing pollution will make our air cleaner, creating healthier communities while ensuring equity for all Canadians.”

  “Economists for a long time have been pointing to carbon taxes, or carbon pricing, as the most efficient or most cost-effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”

Ottawa, ON – Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party of Canada announced today that the Hon. Ralph Goodale, Member of Parliament for Regina—Wascana, and Mona Fortier, Member of Parliament for Ottawa—Vanier, will serve as Co-Chairs of the party’s National Platform Committee in advance of the 2019 federal election campaign.
“Hearing ideas from Canadians directly has always been at the heart of our work together to keep the economy strong, create good new jobs, and make sure that everyone has a real and fair chance at success,” said Justin Trudeau, Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. “Ralph and Mona’s experience and leadership will help us engage even more Canadians in shaping our positive plan to create more opportunity for the middle class and everyone working hard to join it.”
Fortier and Goodale will begin discussions and consultations with business, labour, environmental, Indigenous, and community leaders across Canada, in addition to continuing to hear new ideas from grassroots Liberals, the Liberal caucus, and Canadians directly.
These new conversations will build on the Liberal Party of Canada’s work to build the most open, inclusive, and engaging movement in Canadian politics – with nearly 6,000 Canadians having already participated in national online policy voting ahead of April’s 2018 Liberal National Convention in Halifax. Liberal volunteers also recently started hundreds of thousands of new conversations with Canadians as part of 579 Summer of Action events across Canada in July and August.
Mona Fortier has served as the Member of Parliament for Ottawa-Vanier since April 2017, and has extensive previous experience and expertise in the areas of health care, education, job creation and francophone affairs. The Hon. Ralph Goodale was first elected to Parliament in 1974. He is currently the Member of Parliament for Regina—Wascana and Canada’s Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. In 2015, he served as Co-Chair of the National Liberal Platform Committee. Previously, he has also served as Canada’s Minister of Finance, Minister of Public Works, Minister Natural Resources, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, and Leader of the Government in the House of Commons.

Just got off the phone with Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau – thank you so much for calling to talk about Owen Sound’s first pride parade! It was an honour to discuss the importance of LGBTQ+ initiatives and the way our community came together.  ️‍

On August 19th, Justin Trudeau accepted his 2019 Liberal nomination for the riding of Papineau. With many more nomination events to go in the weeks ahead, Liberals all across Canada are working tirelessly to keep building a talented and diverse group of candidates to run in next year’s important election campaign. 

From knocking on doors, to making phone calls, to discussing important issues that matter to you at events in your community, our movement is growing fast. But don’t just take our word for it — watch Justin Trudeau’s nomination speech above to see how your support has an impact. Hope and hard work? That is what politics is really all about.
“Because at the end of the day, politics is about people. Not about voting trends, statistical models, or economic projections, but about people. You taught me that.”
Justin TrudeauLeader of the Liberal Party of Canada

It’s about providing more money to 9/10 Canadian families with the Canada Child Benefit, which has also lifted 300,000 kids out of poverty. It’s about strengthening the Canada Pension Plan so that seniors can count on a secure and dignified retirement after a lifetime of hard work. It’s about Canadians creating more than 600,000 new jobs since 2015, with the lowest unemployment rate in over 40 years. It’s about working hard to strengthen the middle class and make life better for everyone working hard to join it – and so much more.
With just over one year until the 2019 election, there is a lot of work ahead of us. Together, we can continue to build an even better future for all Canadians.
Chip in now to help re-elect Justin Trudeau and to elect our Liberal candidates across Canada!
